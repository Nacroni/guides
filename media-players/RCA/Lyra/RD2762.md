## Software

> The software mentioned here only runs on Windows devices natively. You *could* use [WineHQ](http://winehq.org) to run it on POSIX-compatible systems *(Mac, GNU/Linux, etc.)* however there is no guarantee that the software will work.

> **IMPORTANT: Before plugging in your device to use these programs, make sure your Lyra device's USB protocol is MSC. Lyra Applications & Lyra DJ do *NOT* support MTP.** You can change this setting by: opening the Menu (press the "M" button on the device), navigating to Settings, then Advanced, and then switch the protocol being used by pressing the center button.
